Dungeon Room 1
This room is choked with corpses. The bodies of orcs and ogres lie in tangled heaps where they died, and the floor is sticky with dried blood. It looks like the orcs and ogres were fighting. Some side was the victor but you're not sure which one. The bodies are largely stripped of valuables.

Dungeon Room 2
Stone blocks of all sizes squat in this chamber under a thin layer of dust. Some of the blocks are completely square, but many of them show evidence of the sculptor's chisel: Rough heads, arms, faces, and other forms are visible. A workbench against the eastern wall is cluttered with ruster stoneworking implements of common design.

Dungeon Room 3
Rows of empty weapon racks and a dozen or more stands for missing suits of armor indicate that this room was once an armory. Some debris litters the floor--wrecked stands and hacked arming dummies, but nothing of value is readily apparent.

Dungeon Room 4
In the center of this room lies a 30-foot-wide round pit, its edges lined with rusting iron spikes. About 5 feet away from the pit's edge stand several stone semicircular benches. The scent of sweat and blood lingers, which makes the pit's resemblance to a fighting pit or gladiatorial arena even stronger.

Dungeon Room 5
You inhale a briny smell like the sea as you crack open the door to this chamber. Within you spy the source of the scent: a dark and still pool of brackish water within a low circular wall. Above it stands a strange statue of a lobster-headed and clawed woman. The statue is nearly 15 feet tall and holds the lobster claws crossed over its naked breasts.

This stark, square room seems barely lived in. Only a single cot and an empty armor rack keep it from appearing to be nothing more than a closet.
